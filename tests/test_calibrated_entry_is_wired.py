"""AI9 — walk-forward must not certify a run it never made, and the calibrated
entry policy must be able to reach a trade.

Two halves of one finding: the optimiser's output never reaches trading.

HALF 1 — ``jarvis.backtesting.walk_forward.WalkForwardEngine``
--------------------------------------------------------------
The engine has no production caller (only ``compare_performance.py`` and a dead
import in ``tests/test_backtesting_lab.py``), so none of this was reachable.
That makes the fallback branch the most dangerous part of it: with fewer than
200 bars it ran a single in-sample backtest and returned

    walk_forward_efficiency = 1.0     passed_wfe = True

A perfect score and a pass, for a run in which no out-of-sample window was ever
measured. The one case that could not validate was the one case that certified
itself — and ``compare_performance.py`` printed it as ``PASSED``.

The same branch also named its fold key ``wfe`` where every validated fold uses
``wfe_fold``, so a consumer reading the real key hit a ``KeyError`` on exactly
the runs it most needed to treat carefully.

A pass is now also *explained*. ``passed_wfe`` was
``WFE >= 0.50 or OOS profit factor >= 1.25``, so a validation whose edge was
entirely lost (WFE 0.00) could still report ``passed_wfe: True`` on an absolute
profit factor alone, with nothing saying so.

HALF 2 — the calibrated entry policy
------------------------------------
``config/winrate_profiles.json`` holds 16 calibrated symbol profiles,
``jarvis.execution.entry_policy.evaluate_entry`` implements the policy, and
``RiskEngine.authorize_execution`` / ``TradeGuard.validate_pre_execution``
already accept ``entry_authorized_override`` for its verdict. Nothing joined
them: ``evaluate_entry`` had exactly one caller outside tests, the backtest
engine, so live entry selection still ran on the legacy 29-check stack that
``entry_policy`` itself documents as unvalidated.

The wire is added behind ``trading.use_calibrated_entry_policy``, default OFF.
That default is deliberate, not timidity: 11 of the 16 profiles on disk carry a
NEGATIVE out-of-sample expectancy, so enabling the policy refuses most of the
universe. Switching a live book from 16 symbols to 5 is a trading decision and
is left to the operator.

**Coverage honesty.** ``run_cycle_for_symbol`` cannot be driven without a live
MT5 client, and the walk-forward engine's validated path needs real H1 history,
so the fallback branch is driven with a patched ``BacktestEngine`` and the
wire is driven through the orchestrator's own helper. The guard-keying change
(``wants_entry``) is pinned by source assertion.
