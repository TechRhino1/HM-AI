"""Spread symmetry between the BUY and SELL stop branches of DynamicRiskAndLevelsEngine.

`calculate_levels` prices the stop from the entry, and the entry is the side of the
book the order crosses: a BUY pays the ask, a SELL the bid, and either stop fills on
the far side. So ``spread_dist`` belongs in the stop distance in BOTH directions.

The SELL branch added ``spread_dist`` at every site (the structural distance, the
fallback structural distance, the SCALP/DAY caps and the SWING cap). The BUY branch
did not, which made every BUY stop systematically one spread tighter than the
mirrored SELL stop for identical structure — a directional asymmetry produced by an
inconsistency, not by any trading view.

These tests pin the symmetry and would fail on the pre-fix engine, where the BUY
risk distance came out exactly ``spread_dist`` short of the SELL risk distance.
