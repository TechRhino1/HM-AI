"""The historical/backtest path must initialize the terminal and resolve the
symbol before it asks MT5 for bars.

Why this exists
---------------
A backtest run never places an order, so nothing in that process ever called
`mt5.initialize()`. Two defects followed, both measured against a live terminal:

1. Every `mt5.*` call returned `None` with `(-10004, 'No IPC connection')`, so
   `copy_rates_range` "found no history" and the run fell through to the refusal
   path. `MT5_AVAILABLE` only means the package *imported* — it is not evidence
   the terminal is up in this process. Measured: before `initialize()` -> `None`
   / `(-10004, 'No IPC connection')`; immediately after -> 5 bars.

2. `MT5Client.resolve_symbol_name` returns the input UNCHANGED whenever the
   client is in paper mode or simply not connected — i.e. in every historical
   process. The broker calls gold `GOLD.i#`, so asking for `XAUUSD` returned 0
   bars, and 0 bars is indistinguishable from "the broker has no history for
   this range".

Both made `tests/test_backtest_with_historical_engine.py` fail. These tests pin
the two fixes: the gate runs before any terminal call, and an unresolved symbol
is resolved against the terminal rather than trusted.
