"""Mode-scoped persistence for risk-control state.

THE DEFECT THESE TESTS EXIST FOR
--------------------------------
``RiskEngine`` and ``JarvisOrchestrator`` both build a ``DrawdownGuard`` (and a
``CircuitBreaker``) with a filename and no mode, so PAPER and LIVE wrote to the
same ``data/jarvis_drawdown_state.db``. The two modes do not measure equity on the
same scale — paper reports ``equity = 10000.0 + paper_pnl`` while the live account
here holds a few hundred dollars — and ``peak_equity`` moves **up only** and is
never reset daily (only ``daily_start_equity`` re-anchors on a date change).

Observed live consequence: a paper session had left ``peak_equity = 10150.0`` in
the shared file. Against a real equity of 777.00 that is a 92.34% drawdown versus
a 10% cap, so ``check_limits()["passed"]`` was False, ``get_risk_multiplier()``
returned 0.0, and the engine refused **every** trade — at ``risk_engine.py:201``,
``risk_engine.py:405`` (``authorized: False, lots: 0.0``) and the
``orchestrator.py`` EXECUTE->WAIT backstop. The account could not trade at all,
and nothing in the UI said why.

Note the asymmetry, which is what made this hard to read: ``daily_start_equity``
*does* self-heal to the current equity on a new UTC day, so the daily-loss cap was
never the problem. Only the portfolio peak is permanently poisoned.

The fix scopes each persistence file to the execution mode
(``jarvis.config.paths.mode_scoped_db_path``). ``live`` deliberately keeps the bare
filename so existing live baselines are not orphaned.

These tests are marked ``drawdown_persistence`` because ``tests/conftest.py``
otherwise forces ``db_path=""`` (in-memory) on every guard, which would make every
assertion about a path vacuous.
