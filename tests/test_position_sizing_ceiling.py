"""The configured per-trade risk ceiling must actually bind.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The worst trade in the live journal was a BOT order for **17.19 lots of
SOLUSD**, which risked **$84 on a $4,500 account — 1.87%, or 3.7x the
configured 0.5% limit**. On today's code the same trade sizes to 4.59 lots
(0.50%), so the ceiling itself was fixed before this test was written. What was
missing was anything that would notice if it regressed: `position_sizing.py`
once clamped to a HARDCODED literal `1.50` while applying `invalidation_risk_coefficient`
and `combined_scaler` OUTSIDE that clamp, so a high-conviction trade scaled the
0.5% base by up to ~1.55x and the setting was never enforced. Measured then: 27
real trades breached it, the worst risking 39% of equity (78x the limit).

These tests assert the contract, not the arithmetic: the multipliers a caller
passes may only REDUCE risk below the ceiling, never inflate past it. They are
pure-function tests — `calculate_lot_size` touches no broker.

The one documented exception is the broker minimum-lot floor: when the risk
budget cannot buy even `volume_min`, the sizer either refuses the trade or
accepts the minimum lot, and it allows that only while the forced risk stays
within `min(3.0, 2 * effective_risk_pct)`. That 2x allowance is deliberate and
is asserted here so it cannot silently widen.
