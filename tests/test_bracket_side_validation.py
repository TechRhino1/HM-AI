"""A recovered bracket must not be stored on the wrong side of entry.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`sync_mt5_history` does not read `sl`/`tp` from the broker — it recovers them by
string-parsing the order comment (`[sl...]` / `[tp...]`). That parse had no
direction check, so a comment carrying the wrong number was written straight
into the journal. Measured on data/jarvis_history.db: **24 rows had a stop on
the WRONG side of entry** — 14 BUY with `sl >= entry`, 10 SELL with `sl <= entry`
— and the 20 closed ones among them were **20 winners totalling +37.38**, which
a genuine stop cannot produce. That is the signature of the TAKE-PROFIT level
having been parsed into the `sl` field.

This is not a duplicate of `trade_guard.validate_pre_execution`, which refuses an
inverted bracket at ORDER BUILD time. The point here is the other end: a value
that arrives through the comment parse cannot have come from a valid order, so it
must not be persisted either.

The positive control matters as much as the rejection: a guard that refuses
everything would also make this test pass while destroying the data.
