"""A closed trade must record HOW IT LEFT, not only how it entered.

`executed_trades` had a column for every part of the entry — `entry_price`, `sl`,
`tp`, `volume`, `expected_value` — and none for the outcome. So a closed row had
nowhere to put its exit price or its realised P&L, and the only place a real
figure existed was a request-time dict built from live MT5 deals in
`server.py:669`, never written back to the file. Measured consequences:

* every closed row reported `realized_pnl == expected_value` — the pre-trade
  estimate echoed back, so nothing was learned once a trade closed;
* `copilot.py` read `r.get("realized_pnl")` and silently got `0`, because the
  key was never stored;
* 42/93 rows in `data/jarvis_trade_memory.db` showed `exit_price=0, pnl=0`.

The hard part is not adding the columns, it is keeping **"unknown" distinct from
"zero"**. A `0.0` P&L is a real break-even trade; a `dict.get()` on a missing key
also yields `0.0`; and `realized_pnl` shipped with `DEFAULT 0.0`, so a row that
had never closed and a row that closed flat were the same value. NULL is the only
honest encoding of "not recorded", and these tests pin it.
