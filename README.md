# HM Algo 2.0 — Institutional Quantitative MT5 Trading System

An institutional-grade, multi-factor adaptive algorithmic trading architecture built for MetaTrader 5 (MT5). The system integrates Smart Money Concepts (ICT/SMC), Wyckoff accumulation/distribution frameworks, Minervini Trend Templates, Volatility Contraction Patterns (VCP), dynamic Fractional Kelly risk management, and a **calibrated win-rate pipeline** to achieve high-expectancy trade execution.

## 🏛️ Master Trader Architecture & Core Innovations

### 1. ICT Fair Value Gap (FVG) & Order Block (OB) Imbalance Engine
- **Fair Value Gap Detection:** Identifies 3-candle price imbalance zones (unmitigated liquidity voids) across multiple timeframes.
- **Order Block Mapping:** Locates high-volume displacement candles that create confirmed Breaks of Structure (BOS).
- **Optimal Trade Entry (OTE):** Calculates precision Fibonacci retracement entries (62.0%, 70.5% sweet spot, and 79.0%) aligned with institutional dealing ranges.
- **Imbalance Mitigation Tracking:** Actively filters out invalidated or mitigated zones in real time.

### 2. Multi-Timeframe Institutional Dealing Range & Premium/Discount Filtering
- **True HTF Equilibrium:** Computes institutional dealing ranges over 200-bar macroeconomic lookbacks.
- **Directional Zone Enforcement:** Hard-blocks BUY entries in Premium zones (top 50% of range) and SELL entries in Discount zones (bottom 50% of range) unless supported by confirmed liquidity sweep reversals.

### 3. Session Killzone Timing Engine
- **Forex Session Gating:** Restricts Forex entries strictly to high-liquidity institutional windows:
  - **London Open Killzone:** 07:00 – 10:00 UTC (initial directional expansion)
  - **New York Open Killzone:** 12:00 – 15:00 UTC (highest volume & overlap)
  - **London Close Window:** 15:00 – 17:00 UTC (mean reversion & position unwinding)
  - **Asian Range Reference Box:** 00:00 – 07:00 UTC (defines liquidity boundary sweeps)

### 4. Advanced Regime & Confluence Stack
- **Wyckoff / ICT Fusion:** Recognizes Wyckoff Springs, Upthrusts, Accumulation/Distribution phases, and Change of Character (CHoCH).
- **Minervini Trend Template & VCP:** Measures multi-stage volatility contractions and multi-timeframe moving average slope alignment.
- **Hard Confluence Gate:** Enforces institutional quality hurdles (Score >= 65/100 for Forex, >= 55/100 for Commodities & Crypto).

### 5. Professional Trade Management & Execution Protocol
- **Asset-Adaptive Partial Exits:**
  - Takes 33% profit at 1.5R (Forex) or 1.8R (Gold/Crypto).
  - Automatically moves Stop Loss to true Breakeven (0.0R) to eliminate downside risk on remaining position.
- **Dynamic ATR Chandelier Trailing Stop:** Trails remaining runner positions with a 1.5x ATR buffer from recent swing extremes, allowing macro trends to run without premature suffocation.
- **24-Bar Time Stop:** Force-closes stale, non-moving trades after 24 hours on H1 if 0.5R favorable excursion is not achieved, preventing capital lock-up.

### 6. Consecutive Loss Circuit Breakers & Fractional Kelly Position Sizing
- **Streak Protection:**
  - 2 consecutive losses -> automatically cuts position risk by 50%.
  - 3 consecutive losses -> activates a 4-bar mandatory cooling-off period.
  - Daily Drawdown >= 3.0% -> halts all new executions for the remainder of the trading day.
- **Dynamic Kelly Allocation:** Dynamically scales trade size using Quarter-Kelly optimal sizing adjusted for high-water mark drawdown.

### 7. Execution Mode Safety Gate (`JARVIS_CONFIRM_LIVE=1`)
- **Default Safety Guard:** If execution mode is configured to `"live"` without `JARVIS_CONFIRM_LIVE=1` explicitly set in environment variables, the system logs a prominent warning banner and safely forces execution mode to `"paper"`.
- **Live Trading Safeguard:** Prevents accidental real-money order execution from unvalidated configuration files or default startup scripts.

### 8. End-to-End Limit & Pending Order Pipeline
- **Retracement & Level Routing:** Automatically routes setups to `BUY_LIMIT` or `SELL_LIMIT` pending orders when entry price requires retracement to key structural levels (FVG, Order Block, liquidity sweeps).
- **Direction & Price Sanity Checks:** Validates limit price geometry (`BUY_LIMIT` < live bid, `SELL_LIMIT` > live ask) and falls back safely to market orders if price has already crossed the level.
- **Watchdog Stale Cleanup:** Automatically cancels unfilled pending orders exceeding configurable TTL (default 30 mins) during background orchestrator ticks.
- **Web Terminal UI & API:** Integrated `GET /api/pending_orders` and `POST /api/action/cancel_pending_order` endpoints with dedicated "Pending Orders" table tab in the Web Terminal.

### 9. Secure Cookie Authentication Model
- **HttpOnly & SameSite=Strict:** Authentication tokens are issued exclusively via secure `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` cookies, preventing token theft from client-side scripts.
- **Zero LocalStorage Tokens:** Eliminates client-side JWT token storage in `localStorage` / `sessionStorage`.

### 10. Asset-Class Specific Strategy Specialization
- **Commodities (XAUUSD/Gold, XAGUSD/Silver):** High-momentum trend following and break-of-structure expansion with structure-anchored stops.
- **Forex Majors (EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, AUDUSD, USDCAD, USDCHF, NZDUSD):** Range mean reversion (Bollinger Band 20, 2.0 SD with ADX < 22) and killzone liquidity sweep reversals.
- **Crypto (BTCUSD, ETHUSD, SOLUSD):** High-volatility swing momentum and multi-timeframe FVG pullbacks.
- **Indices (US30, NAS100, GER40, UK100):** Breakout momentum and session-driven volatility capture.

## 🎯 New in v5.0 — Calibrated Win-Rate Pipeline

### Four-Stage Split Architecture
Win rate is treated as a **constrained objective**: maximise expectancy subject to `win_rate >= target`.

| Stage | Module | Cost | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Signal scan | `jarvis/backtesting/signal_scan.py` | ~30 s/symbol | Every directional candidate the live pipeline considered |
| 2. Trade simulation | `jarvis/backtesting/trade_simulator.py` | ~1–2 s/geometry | Outcome in R for one exit geometry |
| 3. Calibration | `jarvis/intelligence/winrate_targeting.py` | seconds | Per-symbol profile (walk-forward) |
| 4. Entry selection | `jarvis/execution/entry_policy.py` | — | Allow / deny at runtime |

### Key Pipeline Features
- **Isotonic Calibration (PAV):** Maps confluence scores to realised win probabilities, making scores interpretable rather than arbitrary indices.
- **Walk-Forward Cross-Validation:** `PurgedKFold` with embargo ensures geometry selection happens only on training folds, reported honestly on purged out-of-sample data.
- **Regime-Edge Policy:** Learned per-symbol regime enable/disable decisions, fitted on training folds only to prevent test-set leakage.
- **Hermetic Backtesting:** All persistent-state reads/writes are disabled during simulation (`jarvis.config.runtime`), guaranteeing reproducible and deterministic results.

## 🔒 Hermetic Backtesting Guarantee

All persistent-state reads and writes on the decision path are disabled during simulation via `jarvis.config.runtime`:

- `RealtimeOptimizer` reads no live PnL history
- `OnlineMLPredictor` does not load or save model weights
- `SelfLearningEngine` starts from neutral priors
- `MetaLabeler` remains neutral (untrained)
- `ConfidenceCalibrationEngine` does not influence scores

This guarantees **reproducible, deterministic backtests** that measure the strategy as specified — not as mutated by unrelated live trading history.
