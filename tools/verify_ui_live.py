"""Live end-to-end check of the redesigned dashboard and the API surface.

Starts the real HTTP server on a scratch port with no broker attached, then
exercises every route the browser would call.

Usage (from the repo root):

    python tools/verify_ui_live.py

Exit code is 0 when every check passes, 1 otherwise, so it can gate a release.

Three things this script deliberately proves rather than assumes:

* ``/api/action/auto-select`` stays a dry run even when asked to go live. The
  HTTP surface must have no path that can open a trade.
* With no orchestrator attached, auto-selection reports ``UNAVAILABLE`` with a
  reason instead of returning an empty-but-successful selection. Failing safe
  and saying so is the correct behaviour; a 200 with no decisions would let a
  caller mistake "engine not wired" for "nothing to trade".
* Every route that returns modelled, fixed or placeholder values says so in its
  own payload. A UI cannot label what the backend does not describe, so this is
  checked at the HTTP boundary rather than trusted from the render layer.
