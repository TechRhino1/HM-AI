JARVIS AI 5.0 — Per-Symbol Win-Rate Targeting.

THE MATHEMATICS THAT DRIVES THIS DESIGN
---------------------------------------
Win rate is not an independent objective. For any strategy

    expectancy (in R) = WR * avg_win_R - (1 - WR) * avg_loss_R

so a win rate can always be manufactured by shrinking the target relative to
the stop — a 0.1R target against a 1R stop wins ~90% of the time and loses
money. Tuning to a bare win-rate number is therefore a trap, and a system that
reports "75% win rate" while bleeding expectancy is worse than one that reports
55% honestly.

This module treats the 75% target as a *constrained* objective:

    maximise expectancy_R   subject to   win_rate >= target
                                         trades    >= min_trades
                                         expectancy_R > 0

and reports, per symbol, whether the target is reachable at all and what binds
when it is not. Two consequences are accepted up front and reported rather than
hidden:

  * Reaching a high win rate requires a SMALL target in R. The frontier is
    monotone: smaller tp_r raises win rate and lowers expectancy. The calibrator
    walks that frontier and picks the highest-expectancy point that still clears
    the target.
  * A per-symbol target may be arithmetically unreachable on three months of
    data. When it is, the profile records ``target_met=False`` and names the
    binding constraint instead of overfitting to the sample.

VALIDATION
----------
Every geometry is chosen on a training fold and scored on a purged out-of-sample
fold (``jarvis.learning.walk_forward.PurgedKFold``). The headline win rate in the
report is the OOS figure, never the in-sample fit.

AI COMPONENTS
-------------
1. Confidence calibration — isotonic (PAV) mapping from the engine's raw score to
   a realised win probability, fitted per symbol. This is meta-labeling: it
   learns when the engine is over-confident.
2. Regime-edge policy — a learned table of symbol x regime expectancy, used to
   switch regimes off when they have demonstrated no edge.
3. Regime-conditional geometry — the calibrator may select a different target
   distance per regime (trending markets sustain larger targets than ranges).
4. Self-learning — profiles persist to JSON and can be refit from realised
   outcomes via :meth:`WRProfileStore.merge_realised`.

    because the 75% target is missed far more often than it is met, the

    # win-rate margin guard, (2) rank by the t-statistic of expectancy. Both are
