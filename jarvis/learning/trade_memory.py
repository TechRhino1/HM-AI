    The triple-barrier method (Lopez de Prado) labels a trade **+1** when the upper
    (take-profit) barrier is touched first, **-1** when the lower (stop-loss) barrier is
    touched first, and **0** when the vertical (time) barrier is reached instead. Only the
    *first* touch decides, so strictly the label needs the trade's path -- but this journal
    records only the exit, so the label is derived from the strongest evidence a row
    actually holds: the exit price against the two barriers stored beside it.

    Returns ``None`` when the row cannot answer the question (no exit, no usable entry, or
    no barriers), so **"unlabelled" stays distinguishable from "the vertical barrier was
    hit"**. That distinction is the whole point here. The previous code wrote ``0`` at
    *open* time, from a ``pnl`` that does not exist yet, and ``update_closed_trade`` never
    revisited the column -- so every row was labelled "vertical barrier" whether or not it
    was. Measured on the live journal: 36/36 rows at 0 (one distinct value), of which 8
