/**
 * HM Algo 2.0 — MOBILE DOCK BOOTSTRAP
 *
 * The market pages render their bottom dock server-side, so its buttons are
 * tappable the moment the HTML paints. The handler that drives them, however,
 * lives in the page controller (stocks.js / india.js / india_options.js), which
 * is a blocking <script> near the END of the document. An inline
 * onclick="switchMobileStocksView('screener')" resolves that identifier at
 * CLICK time in global scope, so any tap landing in that window threw
 * "switchMobileStocksView is not defined" and the dock did nothing at all.
 *
 * That window is not theoretical: the page controllers are 1000+ lines and sit
 * ~500 lines of markup after the dock, and stocks.html / india.html additionally
 * pull lightweight-charts with a document.write CDN fallback in <head>, which
 * can stall parsing and widen the gap further.
 *
 * This file installs the three dock entry points up front so the dock is
 * functional from first paint. Each one applies the selected state immediately
 * and hands the view to the real controller as soon as it registers - so a tap
 * that arrives before the controller loads is honoured rather than dropped.
 *
 * Load it BEFORE the dock markup, without defer:
 *     <script src="/static/js/mobile_dock.js"></script>
 *     ...dock buttons with onclick="switchMobileStocksView('x')"...
 *
 * The controller then registers its real behaviour instead of assigning the
 * global directly:
 *     window.registerMobileView('stocks', applyMobileStocksView);
 *
 * Controllers still work if this file is absent - they fall back to assigning
 * the global themselves.
