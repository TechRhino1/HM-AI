        `days` narrows the window. It defaults to None — no window — so the
        callers that predate it (the classic terminal, the console) keep exactly
        the behaviour they have always had.

        The dashboard passes the user's Window selection here. Until it did, the
        selection reached only the MT5 half of /api/history and left journal rows
        unfiltered, so a "1 day" window answered with a month of trades: measured
        2026-09-17, `days=1` returned 185 rows whose oldest was 24 days old.
        The column is `timestamp` because that is the field the existing sort
        orders by, and filtering on the same field the sort uses keeps the two
        consistent.

        Note the internal sync still uses its own 30-day budget: it decides how
        much history to *populate*, which is a different question from how much
        to *display*.

        `origin` keeps rows whose price came from the given origin(s) — pass one
        string, or a collection to allow several. It is validated against
        :data:`ORIGINS` and an unknown value selects nothing rather than
        silently widening to everything, because a caller asking for
        `origin="real"` must not be handed the full table and believe it filtered.

        `execution_mode` keeps rows produced under the given mode(s): `live`,
        `paper`, `demo`, `unknown`. Use THIS one to separate real money from
        simulated — `origin` cannot do it, because `synthetic` covers a paper
        fill with no quote and a live fill whose client had lost the terminal
        alike. A caller that wants "real money, trustworthy price" asks for
        `execution_mode="live"` AND `origin="broker"`, which is only the same
        set by coincidence today and by no means guaranteed to stay that way.
