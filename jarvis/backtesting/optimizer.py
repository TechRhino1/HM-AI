"""
HM Algo 2.0 — Backtest Optimiser (maximum-profit geometry search on real MT5 data).

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
----------------------
The calibrator answers "which geometry hits a target win rate on this symbol?".
That is a *constraint satisfaction* question, and it is the wrong question when
the goal is profit. A geometry can be the best win-rate match on a symbol and
still lose money, because win rate and expectancy are not the same objective and
the target itself was chosen by a heuristic.

This module asks the direct question instead: **over the real 6-month MT5
history, which entry-selectivity + exit-geometry configuration produces the most
money, subject to constraints that keep the answer honest?**

THE FOUR IDEAS THAT MAKE THE ANSWER TRUSTWORTHY
-----------------------------------------------
1. **Simulate once, threshold for free.**
   A trade's outcome depends on the geometry and the forward price path — never
   on which other trades were taken. ``min_score`` only decides which simulated
   trades are *kept*. So the expensive simulation is cached per geometry (keyed
   by everything except ``min_score``) and every selectivity threshold is then a
   cheap filtering pass over the same outcomes. A
   ``geometries x thresholds`` grid therefore costs ``geometries`` simulations,
   not ``geometries x thresholds``. This is the only reason a full-universe
   search is affordable on this machine.

2. **Costs are charged, not assumed away.**
   ``simulate_all_candidates`` defaults to zero commission and zero slippage. A
   search run with those defaults would select the geometry that best exploits
   the omission — typically the one with the most stop-outs — and report an edge
   the engine cannot realise. Round-turn commission is converted to a price
   distance (``commission_per_lot / money_per_unit``) and stop slippage to
   ``slippage_pips * pip_size``, both taken from the same conventions
   ``BacktestEngine`` uses.

3. **The search window and the validation window are disjoint.**
   The optimum is found on the first ``walk_forward_split`` of the history and
   then measured, untouched, on the remainder. Reporting the best in-sample
   number as if it were predictive is the classic way to ship a curve-fit; the
   held-out number is the only one that means anything, and
   ``walk_forward_verdict`` refuses to report a retention ratio for an edge that
   was never profitable in the first place (you cannot retain a fraction of
   nothing).

4. **The bar index means what the scanner thought it meant.**
   Candidates are cached against the frame the scanner actually saw, which for
   some timeframes is *trimmed* (``--since``) because a mode's usable window is
   the intersection over its timeframes — M5/M1 is capped by M1 history. Loading
   the untrimmed parquet would leave every ``bar_idx`` pointing one offset
   out — silently, with plausible-looking results, since the arrays are still
   long enough to index. ``load_series`` replays the trim from the scan manifest
   for exactly this reason.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO
----------------------------
It does not touch the live path. It reads the cached candidate tables and the
real price history, searches, and writes a report. Wiring the winner into the
engine is a separate, deliberate step — and it must go through
``jarvis.backtesting.exit_geometry.build_exit_geometry`` so that live and
backtest share one schedule.
