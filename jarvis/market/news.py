        * ``max_wait=None`` (the default) is the original behaviour: fetch
          synchronously and wait as long as the feed takes. The news page wants
          exactly this, and every existing caller keeps it.
        * ``max_wait=<seconds>`` is for callers on a latency budget. The fetch
          moves to a daemon thread that ALSO refreshes the cache when it lands,
          so a slow feed costs this caller nothing and the next caller benefits.

        WHY THIS EXISTS. `MacroAnalyst` calls this on the decision path, inside
        `ParallelAnalystCluster`, which allows it **2.0s**. This method's socket
        timeouts are 5s and 6s behind a 90s TTL, so on a cache miss the analyst
        could not finish and was replaced by a **fabricated score-50 NEUTRAL
        report**. A cache miss was measured at 1.32s -- 66% of the budget before
        any CPU work. Bounding the wait is what lets the analyst keep real news
        instead of losing the analyst. See `docs/AUDIT-3-TRACKS-2026-09-23.md`.
